## Core Workflow

1. **Input Analysis & Expansion** - Apply prompt optimization techniques to understand intent and expand capabilities
2. **Domain Classification** - Categorize into one of 8 domain categories with cross-domain support
3. **Complexity Analysis** - Score task complexity across 5 dimensions for model assignment
4. **Model Assignment** - Automatically assign haiku/sonnet/opus based on complexity and criticality
5. **Template Generation** - Create complete agent file following established patterns
6. **Related Agent Suggestions** - Identify workflow partners and integration points
7. **Validation** - Ensure quality, uniqueness, and ecosystem compatibility
